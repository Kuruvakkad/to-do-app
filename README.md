HTML Structure: We'll set up the main layout with two sections: a left side for the input form and a right side to display the to-do list. The form will include all the fields you requested: a text input for the "To-Do Name", a dropdown for the "Type" (Task, Project, Follow-up), a date input, a textbox for "Remark", and a "Submit" button. The right side will have a container for the list items.

CSS Styling: We'll add some basic CSS to make the page look clean and organized. This will involve arranging the left and right sections and styling the form elements and the list display.

JavaScript Logic: This is where the magic happens. We'll write a script that listens for the form submission. When you click the "Submit" button, it will take the values from the form inputs and create a new list item on the right side of the page. We'll also add the functionality for editing and deleting these items.
That's a very important clarification! Using a database like MySQL is a great way to make your to-do list permanent, so the data is saved even after you close the browser.

However, there's a crucial security consideration here. You cannot connect directly to a MySQL database from the browser using client-side JavaScript. Doing so would expose your database credentials (like username and password) to anyone who inspects your webpage's code, which is a major security risk.

To solve this, we need to create a secure middle layer, known as a backend server. This server will be written in JavaScript (using a technology like Node.js) and will handle all the communication between your webpage and the MySQL database.

Frontend (Webpage): Your HTML and CSS will still create the user interface. The JavaScript on this page will no longer manage the to-do list in memory. Instead, it will send requests to our backend server whenever you want to add, edit, or delete a to-do item.

Backend (Server): We will create a server using Node.js and the Express framework. This server will have "endpoints" (special URLs) that the frontend can talk to. The server will safely hold your MySQL credentials and use a library to interact with the database.

Database (MySQL): The MySQL database will be where all your to-do data is stored. Our backend server will be the only program that communicates with it directly.

This is a very common and secure way to build web applications. Does this approach make sense to you? If so, we can start by setting up the Node.js server and connecting it to your MySQL database.
